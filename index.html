                        Moose (*Alces alces*), the largest members of the deer family, inhabit boreal forests across North America, Europe, and Asia. Males, distinguished by their broad antlers, can weigh up to 1,600 pounds. Adapted to cold climates, they thrive on a diet of leaves, bark, and aquatic plants. Moose are excellent swimmers and solitary by nature, except during the fall mating season. Predators include wolves, bears, and humans.
